# [net] HTTP

## Intro

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.

It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

Designed in the early 1990s, HTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time.

It is an application layer protocol that is **sent over TCP**, or **over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection**, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used.
