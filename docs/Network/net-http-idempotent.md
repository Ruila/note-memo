# [net] Idempotent

## Intro

From RFC7231 - Section 4.2.2
> A request method is considered "idempotent" if the intended effect on the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the **same as the effect for a single such request**. Of the request methods defined by this specification, PUT, DELETE, and safe request methods are idempotent.
