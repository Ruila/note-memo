# [Spring] IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection)

## IoC

**IoC** enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code.

#### The advantages of this architecture are:

+ decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
+ making it easier to switch between different implementations
+ greater modularity of a program
+ greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies, and allowing components to communicate through contracts
