Hi everyone, I'm William.

This website record a lot of notes or article highlights from my programming life and articles I read.

Making a notes is helping me engage with the material more deeply, which can help you remember it better.

If those notes help you solve the problems, I will be glad to hear that.

Finally, thank you for those amazing writer who wrote those useful and professional articles.
